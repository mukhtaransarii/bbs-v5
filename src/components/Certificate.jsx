          <p><b>Crime:</b> <span className="text-gray-500">Reaching the top tier of frontend chaos by building the smoothest, cleanest version of Ochi ever seen.</span></p>
          <p><b>Allegations:</b> <span className="text-gray-500">
            â€“ Used React like a pro, styled every pixel with Tailwind CSS, added buttery GSAP animations that made devs jealous, and deployed faster than his coffee cooled. <br />
            â€“ Designed in dark mode like a Gen Z signature, pushed pixels like a surgeon, and made even 404 pages look hot. <br />
            â€“ Created Postify using the MEN stack, added SEO + Ads in Nasara, and had the audacity to optimize performance. <br />
            â€“ Suspected of looping lo-fi while breaking the CSS matrix with grid + flexbox combos.

          <p><b>Verdict:</b> <span className="text-gray-500">Found guilty of being way too clean with code and bringing UI with attitude.</span></p>
          <p><b>Sentence:</b> <span className="text-gray-500">Permanent ban from mid dev roles. Forced to accept only senior dev positions, free coffee subscriptions, and occasional interview invitations just for fun. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥</span></p>
